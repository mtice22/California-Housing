# Introduction
Our group was tasked with building a multiple linear regression model to predict California housing prices based on the predictor 'median_house_value'. 

Our visuals included a Residual vs. Fitted and a normal Q-Q plot to check the assumptions made in the multiple linear regression model. The residual vs. fitted model is used to check the linearity assumption based on the shape of a red line. The Normal Q-Q plot checks the expected errors assumption of the multiple linear regression model.

# Description
| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `longitude` | A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west |
| `latitude` | A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north |
| `housing_median_age` | Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building |
| `total_rooms` | Total number of rooms within a block |
| `total_bedrooms` | Total number of bedrooms within a block |
| `population` | Total number of people residing within a block |
| `households` | Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block |
| `median_income` | Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars) |
| `median_house_value` | Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars) |
| `ocean_proximity` | Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea |
